<h2>What is a Slave Society?</h2>

<p>I think we can all agree that, generally, people try to avoid conversations that lead to or point to the word “slave.” It's a term that carries heavy historical baggage, something deeply sacred and undeniably scary.</p>
<p>And yes, it is scary, and it is sacred — but maybe that’s the very reason we avoid it so much. In doing so, we forget to talk about the modern-day slavery we’ve allowed ourselves to live in. It’s the kind of slavery that may not involve chains or physical captivity, but it is still a form of control, and it’s one that we, as a society, have become complicit in.

As a young person, I’ve had the chance to explore and navigate various environments. I’ve walked into religious, social, and even formal institutions where I immediately felt different simply because of how I looked — because I wasn’t dressed in what they deemed “modern enough.”

According to them, the most appropriate way to present myself was in long straight wigs or sleekly styled hair. And let’s be real — I find that approach somewhat repulsive, because as an African, my hair is not sleek, and it simply cannot be sleeked in the way they demand. Why should I spend money on products that are not aligned with my natural beauty, just to fit into someone else’s narrow idea of “perfection”?

But we can’t entirely blame these institutions or associations. If you take a deeper look into the laws and societal systems that govern us, it often feels as if the English legal system — rooted in colonial histories — holds a kind of superiority over the laws created right here in our own lands. If you were to defend a client with cases from the judicial systems of foreign countries, you’d most likely have an edge in the minds of the judges. And that’s because, over time, we’ve internalized the belief that what comes from outside — what is foreign — has greater value and authority than what is homegrown.

We need to ask serious questions about this. I understand that these institutions claim they are “looking out for us,” trying to teach us certain principles. But personally, I question the effectiveness of these principles. Do they actually serve our growth? Or do they just perpetuate systems that force us into molds we don’t belong to?

It’s not just the appearance standards that keep us in chains — it’s the way we have become convinced that everything “foreign” is better, that we must sacrifice our individuality, our culture, and even our comfort to fit into a structure that was never designed for us. And in the process, we’re subtly kept under control, bound by invisible shackles that demand we conform to arbitrary expectations.

This is modern-day slavery: the slavery of conformity, of self-doubt, and of the constant battle against our own identities in favor of a standard set by others. And it’s not always visible — it’s not about physical chains — but it’s there, nonetheless, shaping the way we live, work, and view ourselves. We may not be in literal chains, but in many ways, we are still slaves to an idea of perfection that doesn’t belong to us.

The question we need to ask is: How long will we continue to enslave ourselves to these external expectations? How long will we remain complicit in a system that doesn’t serve us, but instead keeps us in a perpetual state of submission? Modern slavery is not just about physical oppression; it’s about the mental, emotional, and social chains we wear every day, without even realizing they’re there.

Perhaps the first step to liberation is having the courage to break free from these invisible chains — to reject the “perfect” molds that don’t fit us, and to start defining success, beauty, and identity on our own terms. After all, true freedom begins when we stop letting someone else dictate how we should live, how we should look, and how we should be.</p>
