        <h2>OSIMIRI FOR TALES AND WHISPERS</h2>
<p>If someone had told me that a day would come where I would be trending on Instablog for fighting a yellow bus conductor on third mainland bridge, I would have called them insane but unfortunately, my phone was still ringing, I’m sure my mum must have called 50 times by now, only God knows how she heard, I thought she doesn’t even use Instagram, oh wait, Jesus that means my matter has even reached Facebook, I could feel the messages pouring in from all over and all I could think about was Akin and what he would think when he sees it.

I stood up and walked to the mirror in my apartment, I no longer recognized myself, this wasn't the plan, I followed all the YouTube tutorials diligently, some said use turmeric and honey, I did just that, some even said take a bath with oats and milk, I did that too, every morning and night I applied all the products that I spent most of my salary on but still, nothing changed. You see, nobody ever talks about how hard it is to be a lady, every day I would come online and see images of girls with the shiniest and clear skin, then take a look at my reflection in the tiny mirror, that’s always in my bag and wonder why mine was different.

Akin was the third man to walk out of my life because of acne. We met on Instagram, where he took one look at my carefully edited pictures and concluded that I was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was a dark, tall man with the most chiseled jaw I had ever come across and was the first person I would talk to when I wake up and the last person to hear my voice at night for three months. It was the best months I have had in a while, I finally felt like I had found my person and was happy with the relationship until one night, he happily said he was moving to Lagos to finally be with me, immediately we said our goodnights, tears started flowing from eyes and I began to wonder what I had done that God choose to punish me like this, I knew that one day our online relationship would come to an end but I didn’t think it would be soon, he was a tech bro living in South Africa and although we always did video calls, I knew that he would take one look at my face when he saw me and declare that he was no longer interested, so I found an hack on my phone that allowed me to add in filters while on video calls with him, he did not know that I battled with serious acne and I wanted to keep it that way.

After I had gone through the panic and depressive state, I decided that I'm not going to let this relationship go and I need to fight for it, that strengthened my resolve so I contacted my friend Yimika, she was always someone who seemed to have all the answers to any problem and we met up for drinks, I wasted no time in sharing my situation with her and luckily, she understood and even pitied me, she told me that she doesn’t think any local remedy or skincare product would work on my face at the speed I need, but that in her village, there was this mystic stream that was capable of making any wish come true and it was also home to a river goddess called Osimiri who grants you your greatest wish and all you had to do was go there and say what you want. I admit, I did not believe her at first, likeI said yimika had a lot of crazy ideas,
I mean she once made me eat an owl that she killed and cooked herself because she said it would make us wiser but then she kept on talking about it and telling stories of different people who she believed the river goddess had helped.
What she did not know is, I was desperate and ready to try anything even if I didn't fully believe in it, so she did not need to do much convincing, we set out to go to her village in two days' time, I prepared myself and read a lot of books on keeping your relationship strong and ensuring to fight for the love of your life, that strengthened my resolve and when the day came, I was fully ready, we set out and it was truly a journey, we got to the village and then begin to trek into an abandoned forest, we passed many strange objects and even saw a skull on a tree, at that point I was already in doubt of Yimika’s tale but we had gone too far and I needed to know that I had done everything within my power.

Finally, yimika stopped walking, I looked ahead and saw that we were standing at the shore of a black stream, it looked like crystals were in the water and I was almost sure that I could hear music playing from a distance, she told me that I needed to go close to the water and make a wish, I approached the stream and closed my eyes and wished for the most glowing and clear skin to ever be seen and suddenly, the sky became cloudy and rain started pouring down, the thunder sounds were almost deafening, yimika immediately grabbed my hand and said we had to leave.

The road back to lagos, was surprisingly easy and straightforward, I got home and stared at myself in the mirror, hoping the wish does come true before I slept off to Akin’s voice, I dreamt that maggots climbed my face and ate every piece of acne I had on it.

The next morning, I woke up with a strange, unsettling feeling in my gut. Something about my reflection seemed… too perfect. I rushed to the mirror and gasped. My face was flawless. Every pimple, every scar, every imperfection had disappeared overnight, leaving my skin smooth and glowing. I almost couldn’t believe it. For a split second, I thought maybe I had finally found the miracle I had been looking for all along.

As I touched my face, feeling the smoothness beneath my fingertips, I couldn't help but smile. The wish had worked. The river goddess—Osimiri—had granted me the skin I had longed for. But as my excitement surged, something deep inside me hesitated. I remembered Yimika's warning: "Be careful. Osimiri doesn’t give without a price."

But I didn't have time to dwell on it. I had a message from Akin.

“Hey, I'm in town! Can't wait to see you. Been dreaming of your face the whole time I was away.”

My heart raced. I quickly replied, “Same here! Can't wait to see you too!”

I stared at my reflection one more time before I dashed out of the apartment to meet him.

When we met, I could see Akin's eyes light up. His face broke into a wide grin as he took me in, and for a moment, I felt the weight of all the insecurities I had carried for so long fall away. The person he had fallen for—this perfect version of me—was finally standing right in front of him.

“You look... amazing,” Akin said, as if searching for words.

I smiled, feeling a warmth spread through me. I was finally the person I always wanted to be in his eyes. But as I basked in his admiration, there was a strange, gnawing feeling deep within me. I ignored it, though, choosing instead to enjoy the moment.

We spent the entire day together, walking through markets, laughing, and talking about everything we had missed during our time apart. For the first time in forever, I felt beautiful—truly, undeniably beautiful. Akin made me feel like I was perfect just as I was. He never once questioned my appearance or seemed concerned about anything that had ever plagued me before.

But when I returned home that night, something strange happened.

I stared at my reflection in the mirror, expecting the same glowing face that had greeted me that morning. But instead, I saw it. The edges of the perfect skin I had worked so hard for were beginning to fade—slowly, at first, like a soft, almost imperceptible blur. My face that had been flawless just hours ago now looked... different. Pockmarks began to reappear. Small, angry red bumps surfaced along my cheeks, and the smooth texture I had so eagerly admired was slipping away, bit by bit.

I stepped closer to the mirror, my breath shallow, panic rising within me.

What is happening?

I didn't understand. I had gotten exactly what I wanted. My skin had been perfect—for him. But not for me.

In the days that followed, the change became more pronounced. By the time I saw Akin again, the illusion had started to crumble completely. My face was starting to look worse than it ever had.

The problem was, when I was with him, the perfection stayed. Akin never saw the blemishes, the way my skin was deteriorating. It was like the goddess had cursed me with a twisted trick—my beauty only remained when he was around, but when I was alone, my face returned to its former state. The acne, the scars, everything. My reflection was a cruel reminder of what I had bargained for.

I called Yimika, desperate. But her line wasn't going through, so I decided to go to her house and since It was impromptu I made an awful decision of taking public transport and that's when it happened, immediately, I entered the bus, I could feel stares on me and I was wondering what was wrong, I took out my tiny mirror and I saw huge boil like sores on my face, the raggedly looking conductor looked at me and said "Aunty, why your face be like dis", the lagos girl in me, quicky retorted "Oga, wetin be your concern", he looked at me and mockingly said "all this Lagos girls their own na to use different creams for face finish, see the way kro kro full your face and you old oo, how you go find husband like this" that set a fire ablaze in my heart and I immediately gave him a slap, he dragged my shirt and before you know it, we were outside the bus on the road and given an heading on instablog "Lagos babe beats bus conductor on third mainland bridge"</p>
